# surface-13_nn
Processing of the experimental data from a Surface-13 experiment for training NN decoders

# 1) Process experimental data

The experimental datasets (`npy` files) should be copied/moved to the `delft_data` directory. 
Run the commands in `run_commands.sh` (this can be done in Unix systems by executing `./run_commands.sh` in the bash terminal). 
The training, validation, and testing datasets will be stored in the new `nn_data` directory.
